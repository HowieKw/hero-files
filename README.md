# Phase 4 Project: Hero Files

Hero Files is a fun app that will allow users to look up heroes and learn about their details and stats. Each hero will also have their own fun animation within their profiles and users can favorite their most liked heroes as well. 

This project was prepared in mind to practice and hone in all the lessons and practice I honed with working with a frontend and backend of an application. At some point I would like to add a proper profile page and get the like button to work as well as add a comments feature in each super profile. Also to add a feature to create your own superteam. After that I will try and add a feature to be able to add more heroes and even villains so the database can be expanded more easily.

This is a JavaScript application made with React with backend Ruby Rails. 

## How to Install Hero Files Application.
1. Use your terminal to navigate into the place where you want to clone Hero Files's directory and `git clone` the url.
2. In terminal run `npm install --prefix client` in order to install the necessary packages found in the `package.json` file needed to run this frontend. Also `bundle install` in order to install the necessary gems needed to run the backend.
3. Make sure you run `rails s` for the backend server and then run `npm start --prefix client` to start the front end.
4. This should open up your browser to Hero Files's login page!
